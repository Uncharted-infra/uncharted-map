## ok, now, look through @/Users/ayushsharma/Desktop/Uncharted-infra/uncharted-map/ repo, and optimize and shorten wherever you can. I want to make sure the code is not super long, and can be abridged wherever to maintain infrastructure for the future. When doing this, make sure that the current features, ui, logic, functionality of the site isn't changed and maintained the same way before optimizing the codebase of @/Users/ayushsharma/Desktop/Uncharted-infra/uncharted-map/ .
